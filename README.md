# Merge Sort in C

## 📌 Description
This project implements the **Merge Sort algorithm** in C.  
Merge Sort is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

## 🚀 Features
- Recursive implementation of Merge Sort
- Merging function for combining sorted subarrays
- User input for array size and elements
- Displays array before and after sorting

## 📂 Files
- `merge_sort.c` → Main C source file with Merge Sort implementation
- `README.md` → Documentation of the project

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Save the code in a file `merge_sort.c`
2. Open terminal and compile:
   ```bash
   gcc merge_sort.c -o merge_sort
